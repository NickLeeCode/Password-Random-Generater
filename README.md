Completed Random Password Generator

#Description of what I did

What I did for the Random Password Generator challenge

- I created the variables for all the upper, lower, special, and numbers characters so that the generator has variables to use for the random password
- I added a " function writePassword" so that the password would be written in the generation box
- I added a "getPrompt" so that prompts would pop up when you pressed the generate button
- I made the prompts also ask you how many characters you want the password, if you want uppercase, lowercase, numbers, or speical characters
- I also put "Math.floor" and "Math.random" to give a range for the number of characters pre password, as well as making the password that was generated "random"
